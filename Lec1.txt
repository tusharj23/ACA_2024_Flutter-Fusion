So today, we will be discussing github and its commands.

Github is a VCS i.e. it is a version control system.
The main purpose of a version control system is to enable proper file management and have the history of all the 
versions of our project without having to manually store each version.

Let's talk some common terms:

1. Repo
2. Add
3. Pull
4. Clone
5. Stage
6. Commit
7. Push
8. Fork
9. Branch
10. Merge
11. README
12. Status
13. Restore
14. Fetch
15. Init
16. Checkout

Now, I would like all of you to clone this repo, update this file by filling in details of the commands, and pushing this file to your new repo.

For reference, I would encourage all of you to go through official git documentation.
